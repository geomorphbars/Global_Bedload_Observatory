# SECTIONS TEMPLATE - INSTRUCTIONS
# ==============================================================================
# 
# IMPORTANT: DELETE ALL LINES STARTING WITH '#' BEFORE USING THIS FILE
#               Keep only the header line and data rows
#
# REQUIRED COLUMNS (✅ cannot be empty):
# ------------------------------------
# - section_id: Unique section identifier (format: RIVERID_S01, RIVERID_S02, etc.)
#               Examples: FRA_ARC_S01, USA_COLORADO_S01, CHE_RHONE_S02
#
# - river_id: River identifier (must exist in rivers.csv)
#             Examples: FRA_ARC, USA_COLORADO, CHE_RHONE
#
# - section_name: Name of the measurement section (location name)
#                 Examples: Bourg-Saint-Maurice, Hells Canyon, Trento
#
# - latitude: Latitude in decimal degrees (WGS84)
#             Range: -90 to +90
#             Examples: 45.6234, -33.8688, 46.5167
#
# - longitude: Longitude in decimal degrees (WGS84)
#              Range: -180 to +180
#              Examples: 6.7654, 151.2093, -116.7891
#
# OPTIONAL COLUMNS (can be left empty):
# ----------------------------------------
# - elevation_m: Elevation above sea level in meters
#                Examples: 850, 195, 420
#
# - bankfull_width_m: Bankfull channel width in meters
#                     (morphological feature, not flow-dependent)
#                     This is the width of the active channel at bankfull discharge
#                     Examples: 15, 120, 8
#
# - channel_slope: Channel slope (m/m, dimensionless)
#                  Examples: 0.012, 0.002, 0.008
#                  Typical ranges: 0.001-0.05 for gravel-bed rivers
#
# - morphology_type: Channel morphology type
#                    Examples: pool-riffle, plane-bed, braided, meandering, 
#                             step-pool, wandering, straight
#
# - notes: Additional information (context, accessibility, etc.)
"#          Examples: ""Upstream of dam"", ""Natural forested reach"", "
"#                   ""Regulated flow"""
#
# HOW TO USE:
# -----------
# 1. Copy the example rows above (FRA_ARC_S01, CHE_VENOGE_S01, etc.)
# 2. Replace with your own data
# 3. To add a section, add a new line following the same format
# 4. Keep the column order as shown
# 5. If an optional value is missing, leave it empty: FRA_ARC_S01,FRA_ARC,Name,45.6,6.7,,,,
# 6. DELETE ALL INSTRUCTION LINES (lines starting with #) before using
# 7. Each section must have a unique section_id
# 8. Each section must belong to a river that exists in rivers.csv
#
# COORDINATE GUIDELINES:
# ----------------------
# - Use decimal degrees, NOT degrees/minutes/seconds
# - Use WGS84 datum (most common, used by GPS)
# - Precision: 4-5 decimal places is usually sufficient (~10m accuracy)
# - Northern hemisphere: positive latitude
# - Southern hemisphere: negative latitude
# - East of Greenwich: positive longitude
# - West of Greenwich: negative longitude
